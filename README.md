# üõ†Ô∏è Oil Pan Tracking with Azure Kinect and xArm 

This project implements a visual servoing pipeline that enables an xArm robotic arm to detect, track, and interact with an oil pan using RGB-D data from an Azure Kinect sensor.

The system includes:
- Color-based segmentation
- 3D point cloud pose estimation using RANSAC + ICP
- Real-time robot control based on the estimated pose
